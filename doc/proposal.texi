@c this is the proposal info file

This chapter describes how a fidoconfig config-file is written, which keywords
exist and where to put the file.

@menu
* Location:: Where to put the config file
* Syntax::   Syntax
* Keywords:: Keyword reference
* Example::  Here is a sample configfile which works for me
@end menu

@node Location, Syntax, config file, config file
@section Configfile location
The fidoconfig library searches the config file on different locations:

@table @asis
@item linux:
/etc/fido/config
@item freebsd:
/usr/local/fido/config
@item os2/win32/dos:
c:\fido\config
@end table

Additionally you can set an enviroment variable called @code{FIDOCONFIG} which
points to the file:

@example
set FIDOCONFIG=e:\bbs\fidoconfig\config

FIDOCONFIG=~/fidoconfig/config
export FIDOCONFIG
@end example

The config file(s) must be readable. If you plan to use the autoareacreate
feature the config file must be writeable.

@node Syntax, Keywords, Location, config file
@section Syntax

The configfile must be readable to fidoconfig. If you plan to use
the autoareacreate feature the writing process must have write-access
to the configfile.

All symbols are @strong{not} case-sensitiv.

@{<whiteSpace>@} at the start of the line will be ignored.

All keywords are evaluated as occurring, the first matching 
keyword found is valid. If there are more then one keywords of the 
same type allowed, the first line matching the situation is valid. 
If no match is found, a default-value will be used.

"#" at the start of a line or <whiteSpace>#<whiteSpace> within the 
line starts a comment. The comment ends with the line.

If the first word in a line is an undefined keyword, the line will 
be ignored.

Each keyword has to start a new line.

Currently not supported:

"\" at end of line means that "\" and the following new-line-
character(s) will be ignored. (concatenating lines)

"\" is used as escape-sequence. "\" has to be written as "\\".

non-printable characters can be expressed as \<hexValue>

@node Keywords, Example, Syntax, config file
@section Keywords
All statements are case-@strong{insensitive}. A line which starts with a # is
a comment and will be ignored.

@subsection include
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{include <file>}

@end table

You can include other files into your config file. For example if you would like to
have different config parts, you can include a file and (via cron job or manually)
change the content of this file without changing the rest of the config.
Additionally you can split your config in different parts. So you can
have your fileareas definition in another file than your msgareas definition.
This gives your the ability to have some survey about your config.

This statement can be repeated. But dont make recursive includes. eg include a  file which includes another which includes the first. Although this will be
detected and fixed many times, there is a chance that it will not be detected
one time.

@node address, outbound, include, Keywords

This command specifies which akas your system has. This statement is full 5d
compatible, which means you can have also addresses like @code{2:2433/1245.1@@fidonet.org}.
If the Line options is empty this aka is displayed on all lines. In the above
example this aka is displayed on line 1, 4 and 5.

@end table

This command specifies your outbound path. This outbound path is binkley-style.
A binkley style outbound consists of a base path and subdirectories. Each subdirectory
represents a place for all the files for one zone. The base path is the zone path
for your base zone.

Example:

@example
@table @asis
@item /var/spool/fido/out
This directory contains the files for your base zone.
@item /var/spool/fido/out.003
This directory contains the files for zone 3.
@item /var/spool/fido/out.00A
This directory contains the files for zone 10.
@end table
@end example

The zone directory contains the flow-files for each node. A Flow-file of a node
has the name NNNNFFFF.?lo

@example
@table @asis
@item NNNN
The 4-digit hex-number of the nodes netnumber.
@item FFFF
The 4-digit hex-number of the nodes nodenumber.
@item ?
Here the flavour of the mails can be chosen. @strong{h}old, @strong{c}rash,
@strong{f}normal.
@end table
@end example

For points there is a subdirectory with nodes flowfilename with suffix.pnt. In
this subdirectory the flowfiles have the names PPPPPPPP ( 8-digit point number
in hex).

@subsection forwardPkts
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{forwardPkts <off|secure|on>}
@item Example:
@code{forwardPkts yes}
@end table

If we receive a PKT file that is not addressed to our system, but to this
link of us, this flag controls if the PKT file should be binary
forwarded to this link. The default behaviour is not to forward the pkt
file, but to remain it to @code{<filename>.ntu} and leave it in the
inbound. If you specify @code{<yes>}, the file will instead be forwarded
to the destination link (i.E. put into his arcmail bundle). If you
specify @code{<secure>}, the file will only be forwarded if we have
received it in the secure inbound. You should specify @code{secure} if
the destination link does not check packet passwords.

PKT forwarding can be useful for tunneling purposes, for
instance. Another example is if you are running two nodes, one IP node
at your company and one PSTN node at your home. If you want to show both
node numbers at both mailers, the tossers at each node must forward PKT
files that are addressed to the other node, because they themselves
cannot process it (each tosser has a different node number, because the
systems operate on distinct outbound structures and distinct message
base areas).

@node pause, arcmailsize, forwardPkts, Keywords

default is 500kb.

@node allowEmptyPktPwd, nodelistdir, arcmailsize, Keywords
@subsection allowEmptyPktPwd
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{allowEmptyPktPwd <off|secure|on>}
@item Example:
@code{allowEmptyPktPwd on}
@end table

This flag is useful if you want to generate packet passwords for this link,
but do not want to check the packet passwords that your link sends to you.
This is sometimes necessary as a workaraound if your link sends you netmail
packets without packet passwords, for example.

The default state is off. In this case the incoming packet password must
match the packet password that you defined. This is the most secure option.

If you set this switch to @code{secure}, packets that do not contain a
packet password and are received in the protected inbound will be processed.
You can use this if your uplink sometimes sends you packets without packet
passwords, as a workaround until the uplink has fixed his system. Still, if
you receive packets with @emph{wrong} packet passwords, they will be
rejected.

The setting @code{on} works like the @code{secure} setting, with the
difference that packets without packet passwords are allowed even in the
unprotected inbound directory. It is not recommended to use this setting.


@node nodelistdir, fidouserlist, allowEmptyPktPwd, Keywords
@subsection nodelistDir
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{nodelistDir <path>}
@item Example:
@code{nodelistDir /var/spool/fido/nodelist}
@end table

This command specifies the path where the actual nodelists are or should
be written to. This path contains the raw nodelist (@pxref{nodelist}). Also,
compiled nodelists like the @file{FIDOUSER.LST} will be stored here.

This statement cannot be repeated.

@node fidouserlist, nodelist, nodelistdir, Keywords
@subsection fidoUserList
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{fidoUserList <filename>}
@item Example:
@code{fidoUserList fidouser.lst}
@end table

If this keyword is present, the nodelist compiler (e.g. @code{ulc}) is
instructed to build a user list file with the given filename in the nodelist
directory (@pxref{nodelistdir}). This is a simple text file with fixed line
length that contains user names (nodes, points) and their corresponding node
or pointnumbers. The file is sorted alphabetically by user name (case
insensitive), so that it can be bsearched to implement a quick node numer
lookup functinality. The fido user list file format is understood by
@code{msged}, for example.

@node nodelist, diffupdate, fidouserlist, Keywords
@subsection nodelist
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{Nodelist <name>}
@item Example:
@code{Nodelist nodelist} or @code{Nodelist points24}
@end table

This statement starts a new nodelist definition. All the following
nodelist-related stamtements change the configuration of this nodelist until
a new @code{nodelist} statement is found.

The name that you specify must match the base name (without extension and
without pathname) of the raw, unpacked, nodelist file. The husky tools
@code{ulc} and @code{nlupdate} math the file name case-insensitively, but
other tools may need the exact spelling. The raw nodelist file is
expected to reside in the nodelist directory (@pxref{nodelistdir}).

@node diffupdate, fullupdate, nodelist, Keywords
@subsection diffupdate
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{DiffUpdate <path_and_basname>}
@item Example:
@code{DiffUpdate /var/spool/filebase/nodediff/nodediff}
@end table

Here you can specify the base filename of nodelist difference files
(nodediffs) that are used to keep the corresponding nodelist up to date. The
argument to the DiffUpdate is the full file name with path of a difference
file, without the file extension. For example, if you have a file area at
@file{/var/spool/filebase/24000}, where your ticker places the updates for
the German Pointlist, and those update files are called @file{points24.a26},
@file{points24.a33}, and so on, you would use

@example
DiffUpdate /var/spool/filebase/24000/points24
@end example

The @code{Diffupdate} keyword is used by @code{nlupdate}, for example. The
nodelist updater will unpack the difference file (if it is archived, of
course, unpacked diffs are also supported), apply the diff to the
corresponding nodelist, and delete the temporary unpacked diff again.


@node fullupdate, defaultzone, diffupdate, Keywords
@subsection fullupdate
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{FullUpdate <path_and_basname>}
@item Example:
@code{FullUpdate /var/spool/filebase/nodelist/nodelist}
@end table

This statement works like @code{DiffUpdate} (@pxref{diffupdate}). The
difference is that here you don't specify the location of a nodelist
difference file, but the locations where complete nodelist files/archives can
be found. Some othernets do not (regularly) distribute a nodediff file, but
just hatch a new nodelist every few weeks. In this case, you need the
@code{FullUpdate} statement.

@node defaultzone, nodelistformat, fullupdate,Keywords
@subsection defaultzone
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{DefaultZone <zone>}
@item Example:
@code{DefaultZone 2}
@end table

Some nodelist files do not start with a @samp{Zone} entry. This is the case
for the German Points24 list, for example, but could also happen for
othernets that only have one zone. In this case, you can use the
@code{DefaultZone} keyword to specify the default zone number for all nodes
listed in this nodelist.

@node nodelistformat, netmailarea, defaultzone, Keywords
@subsection nodelistformat
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{Nodelistformat <format>}
@item Example:
@code{NodelistFormat standard} or @code{NodelistFormat Points24}
@end table

Here you can specify the format of the unpacked nodelist. The default is
@samp{standard}; this is the normal Fidonet nodelist format. You can also
specify @samp{points24}, which is needed for the nodelist compiler to
recognise a point list in the German points24 format as such, so that it can
see the proper 5D point numbers instead of the fakenet numbers.
