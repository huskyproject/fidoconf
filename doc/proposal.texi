This chapter describes how a fidoconfig config-file is written, which keywords
exist and where to put the file.

@menu
* Location:: Where to put the config file
* Syntax::   Syntax
* Keywords:: Keyword reference
* Example::  Here is a sample configfile which works for me
@end menu

@node Location, Syntax, , config file
@section Configfile location
The fidoconfig library searches the config file on different locations:

@table @asis
@item linux:
/etc/fido/config
@item freebsd:
/usr/local/fido/config
@item os2/win32/dos:
c:\fido\config
@end table

Additionally you can set an enviroment variable called @code{FIDOCONFIG} which
points to the file:

@example
set FIDOCONFIG=e:\bbs\fidoconfig\config

FIDOCONFIG=~/fidoconfig/config
export FIDOCONFIG
@end example

The config file(s) must be readable. If you plan to use the autoareacreate
feature the config file must be writeable.

@node Syntax, Keywords, Location, config file
@section Syntax

The configfile must be readable to fidoconfig. If you plan to use
the autoareacreate feature the writing process must have write-access
to the configfile.

All symbols are @strong{not} case-sensitiv.

@{<whiteSpace>@} at the start of the line will be ignored.

All keywords are evaluated as occurring, the first matching 
keyword found is valid. If there are more then one keywords of the 
same type allowed, the first line matching the situation is valid. 
If no match is found, a default-value will be used.

"\" is used as escape-sequence. "\" has to be written as "\\".

non-printable characters can be expressed as \<hexValue>

"#" at the start of a line or <whiteSpace>#<whiteSpace> within the 
line starts a comment. The comment ends with the line.

If the first word in a line is an undefined keyword, the line will 
be ignored.

Each keyword has to start a new line.

Currently not supported:

"\" at end of line means that "\" and the following new-line-
character(s) will be ignored. (concatenating lines)

@node Keywords, Example, Syntax, config file
@section Keywords
All statements are case-@strong{insensitive}. A line which starts with a # is
a comment and will be ignored.

@node include, address, sysop, Keywords
@subsection include
@table @asis
@item Syntax:
@code{include <file>}
@item Example:
@code{include /etc/fido/areas}
@end table

You can include other files into your config file. For example if you would like to
have different config parts, you can include a file and (via cron job or manually)
change the content of this file without changing the rest of the config.
Additionally you can split your config in different parts. So you can
have your fileareas definition in another file than your msgareas definition.
This gives your the ability to have some survey about your config.

This statement can be repeated. But dont make recursive includes. eg include a  file which includes another which includes the first. Although this will be
detected and fixed many times, there is a chance that it will not be detected
one time.

@node address, outbound, include, Keywords
@subsection address
@table @asis
@item Syntax:

@item Example:
@code{Address 2:2433/1245 Line 1 4 5}
@end table

This command specifies which akas your system has. This statement is full 5d
compatible, which means you can have also addresses like @code{2:2433/1245.1@@fidonet.org}.
If the Line options is empty this aka is displayed on all lines. In the above
example this aka is displayed on line 1, 4 and 5.
The first address statement is your main aka which will be used by tossers
on different occasions, for example if zone number could not be taken from
the @@INTL Kludge in netmails.

This statement can be repeated.

@strong{The Line option is not supported}
@strong{The domain name is not full supported throughout fidoconfig}

This command specifies your outbound path. This outbound path is binkley-style.
A binkley style outbound consists of a base path and subdirectories. Each subdirectory
represents a place for all the files for one zone. The base path is the zone path
for your base zone.

Example:

@example
@table @asis
@item /var/spool/fido/out
This directory contains the files for your base zone.
@item /var/spool/fido/out.003
This directory contains the files for zone 3.
@item /var/spool/fido/out.00A
This directory contains the files for zone 10.
@end table
@end example

The zone directory contains the flow-files for each node. A Flow-file of a node
has the name NNNNFFFF.?lo

@example
@table @asis
@item NNNN
The 4-digit hex-number of the nodes netnumber.
@item FFFF
The 4-digit hex-number of the nodes nodenumber.
@item ?
Here the flavour of the mails can be chosen. @strong{h}old, @strong{c}rash,
@strong{f}normal.
@end table
@end example

For points there is a subdirectory with nodes flowfilename with suffix.pnt. In
this subdirectory the flowfiles have the names PPPPPPPP ( 8-digit point number
in hex).

For a deeper background on a binkley-style outbound see the binkley-term
documentation and source code.

linkWW is a dos pattern with ? and *.

Route statements are parsed in descending order:
Pseudo-code:

@example
  1) actual = first statement

  2) if linkWWW = msg-destination using pattern matching

  2a) take this routing and return

  2b) else actual = next statement

  3) jump to 2)
  
@end example

if no route statement found whose pattern matchs witch the aka, then the mail
is left alone.
